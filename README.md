# Advanced--Calculator
c++ advanced calculator with file handling

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project is an advanced calculator developed as a team project.

It includes bothy basic and advanced mathematical functionalities.

#FEATURES:

1.BASIC CALCULATOR FEATURES:

addition

subtraction

multiplication

division

power calculation

squareroot

percentage calculation 

modulus operation

 trignometric functions (sin , cos ,tan )

simple menu base calculator 

all calculation are saved in (history.txt)

2.ADVANCED CALCULATOR FEATURES:

factorial calculation

Even and odd number checking 

Prime number checking

view calculation history 

advanced logical operations

#PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS USED:

-Input and output handling using cin and cout

-Variables and data types

-Menu-driven programming

-Loops(for loop,do-while loop)

-Conditional statements (if-else,switch case)

-User-defined functions

-Mathematical functions (sqrt,pow)

-Logical operations (even/odd, prime checking)

-File handling using ifstream and ofstream

-Persistent storage of calculation history

-String handling and file reading
